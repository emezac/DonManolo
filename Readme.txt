I believe Don Manolo center it's potential around the promise that
intelligent products, systems, and services are tools that possess an
incredible enabling ‘power’ in the hands of a user. DM focuses on a
point of sale and concepts that are closely tied to the user.The ability
of the user to take full advantage of the power of new intelligent
products, systems, and services depends on the intensity and quality
of the interaction between ‘man’ and ‘computers’.
